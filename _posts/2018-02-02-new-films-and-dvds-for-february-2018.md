> "Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the Marvel Comics superhero Thor, based on the mythical Norse God of Thunder. Set after the events of [<cite>Avengers: Age of Ultron</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1857597) (2015), Thor finds himself imprisoned on the far side of the universe without the use of his famed hammer.

> "With the villainous and ruthless goddess Hela (Cate Blanchett) looking to instigate Ragnarok, the destruction of Asgard and the entire Asgardian civilisation, Thor faces a race against time to return to his home world and stop Hela's evil scheme before it's too late."

## [<cite>Blade Runner 2049</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2350565)

> "Three decades after the events of [<cite>Blade Runner</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=877382) (1982), replicant K (Ryan Gosling) works as a blade runner for the LAPD, under the command of Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). On his latest assignment to retire an old Nexus-8 model, K discovers a secret that could shatter accepted knowledge of androids' capabilities and in turn makes him question his own purpose.

> "In search of assistance and answers, K seeks out former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), but he is being closely trailed by fellow replicant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), who has been dispatched by replicant manufacturer Neander Wallace (Jared Leto) to find what K is looking for."

## [<cite>Justice League</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2318104)

> "Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot return to star in this superhero action adventure, directed by Zack Snyder, which follows on from the events of [<cite>Batman v Superman - Dawn of Justice</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1996385) (2016).

> "Following Superman (Cavill)'s death, and with the world mourning his demise, Batman (Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gadot) unite to form a team of superheroes to protect Earth from the looming invasion of Steppenwolf (voice of CiaraÃÅn Hinds) and his army of Parademons. They recruit metahumans Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) to join them. But will the new league of heroes be able to put a stop to Steppenwolf's quest for world domination?"

> "After a series of natural disasters strike the globe, countries across the world work together to create a geoengineering programme, called Dutch Boy, to protect the Earth using a series of satellites designed to control the planet's climate.

> "However, years later, the satellites begin to malfunction, leaving the Earth vulnerable to catastrophic climate events. Dutch Boy's original designer Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler), who was unceremoniously forced to leave the project, is chosen to travel to the International Climate Space Station to repair the climate-controlling satellites before the Earth is decimated by a series of cataclysmic natural disasters."
