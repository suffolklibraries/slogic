## [<cite>Dead If You Don't</cite>, by Peter James](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2363977)

The 14th Detective Roy Grace novel from the ever popular peter James probably does not need promotion as we already have a long waiting list for it. When the child of businessman and gambler Kipp Brown is kidnapped Roy Grace is called in to investigate.

## [<cite>Meet Me at the Museum</cite>, by Anne Youngson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2366356)

This will hold a particular interest for Suffolk readers as it is set in the county, Bury St Edmunds to be precise. Look out for a [Meet the Author](/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/) interview with Anne Youngson next week.

> "Professor Kristian Larsen, an urbane man of facts, has lost his wife, along with his hopes and dreams for the future. He does not know that a query from a Mrs Tina Hopgood about a world-famous antiquity in his museum is about to alter the course of his life.

> "Oceans apart, an unexpected correspondence flourishes as they discover shared passions: for history and nature; for useless objects left behind by loved ones; for the ancient and modern world, what is lost in time, what is gained and what has stayed the same.

> "Through intimate stories of joy, anguish, and discovery, each one bares their soul to the other. But when Tina's letters suddenly cease, Kristian is thrown into despair. Can this unlikely friendship survive?"

## [<cite>The Reckoning</cite>, by Yrsa Sigurðardóttir, translated by Victoria Cribb](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2360458)

> "A chilling note predicting the deaths of six people is found in a school's time capsule, 10 years after it was buried. But surely, if a 13-year-old wrote it, it can't be a real threat.

> "Detective Huldar suspects he's been given the investigation simply to keep him away from real police work. He turns to psychologist Freyja to help understand the child who hid the message. Soon, however, they find themselves at the heart of another shocking case."

## [<cite>Cross Her Heart</cite>, by Sarah Pinborough](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2363647)

Sarah's last book, [<cite>Behind Her Eyes</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2186684), was a domestic thriller with a twist. This is sure to be popular too.

> "Promises only last if you trust each other, but what if one of you is hiding something? A secret no one could ever guess. Someone is living a lie. Is it Lisa? Maybe it's her daughter, Ava. Or could it be her best friend, Marilyn?"

## [<cite>Whistle in the Dark</cite>, by Emma Healey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2382557)

Latest novel from the author of the hugely popular [<cite>Elizabeth is Missing</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1679694).

> "Four missing days. Could you cope with not knowing?

> "Jen's 15-year-old daughter goes missing for four agonizing days. When Lana is found, unharmed, in the middle of the desolate countryside, everyone thinks the worst is over. But Lana refuses to tell anyone what happened, and the police draw a blank.

> "The once-happy, loving family return to London, where things start to fall apart. Lana begins acting strangely: refusing to go to school, and sleeping with the light on. As Lana stays stubbornly silent, Jen desperately tries to reach out to a daughter who has become a stranger."

## [<cite>The Testament of Loki</cite>, by Joanne Harris](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2374943)

The sequel to [<cite>The Gospel of Loki</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1774705).

> "Ragnarok was the End of Worlds. Asgard fell, centuries ago, and the old gods have been defeated. Some are dead, while others have been consigned to eternal torment in the netherworld - among them, the legendary trickster, Loki. A god who betrayed every side and still lost everything, who has lain forgotten as time passed and the world of humans moved on to new beliefs, new idol and new deities.

> "But now mankind dreams of the Norse Gods once again, the river Dream is but a stone's throw from their dark prison, and Loki is the first to escape into a new reality. The first, but not the only one. Other, darker, things have escaped with him, who seek to destroy everything that he covets. If he is to reclaim what has been lost, Loki will need allies, a plan, and plenty of tricks."

## [<cite>Jane Seymour: The Haunted Queen</cite>, by Alison Weir](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2361867)
